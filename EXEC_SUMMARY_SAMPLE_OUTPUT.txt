│    • Top 5 projects account for $38,234 (76.5% of total spend)
│    • ProjectA leads at $12,456 (24.9% share) - Volume-driven
│    • ProjectB: $9,876 (19.8%) - Mix-driven (85% premium models)
│    • ProjectC: $7,543 (15.1%) - Inefficiency-driven (2.3x median cost)
│    • Average cost/1k tokens: $0.0245 (org-wide)
│    • 3 projects flagged as inefficient (>1.5x median cost)
│

┌─ [2] HOW ARE USAGE PATTERNS CHANGING?
│    • 5 significant pattern shifts detected over 30 days
│    • Volume spike: +47% on June 15 (15,234 → 22,401 requests)
│    • Prompt inflation: Avg tokens/req grew +32% (48 → 63 tokens)

INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
=====================

[1] WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?
→ Focus on top spenders and their characteristics
→ Look for concentration risk (few projects = most spend)
→ Identify optimization opportunities (inefficient projects)

[2] HOW ARE USAGE PATTERNS CHANGING?
→ Track volume trends for capacity planning
→ Monitor prompt efficiency (tokens/request)
→ Watch cache hit rates for cost optimization
→ Understand model mix shifts (cost implications)

[3] ARE WE ON BUDGET?
→ Pacing Index < 1.0 = Under pace (good)
→ Pacing Index > 1.0 = Over pace (need action)
→ Projected EOM vs Budget = early warning system
→ Risk contributors = projects needing attention

[4] WHERE ARE THE PROBLEMS?
→ Spike Index > 3 = unusual activity (investigate)
→ Inefficiency Index > 1.3 = optimization opportunity
→ Look for patterns in anomalies
→ Prioritize high-cost inefficiencies


KEY METRICS AT A GLANCE:
=========================

Cost Concentration: 76.5% in top 5 projects (HIGH)
Budget Status: 2.2% over projected (MONITOR)
Pattern Shifts: 5 significant changes (REVIEW)
Anomalies: 3 spikes + 2 inefficiencies (INVESTIGATE)


RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
====================

IMMEDIATE (This Week):
□ Review ProjectC inefficiency (2.3x median) - potential savings
□ Investigate June 16 spike (Index 4.23) - root cause
□ Address cache drop (78% → 55%) - configuration issue?

SHORT-TERM (This Month):
□ Set per-project budgets for top 5 spenders
□ Optimize prompt engineering (32% token inflation)
□ Review GPT-4 usage patterns (35% → 53% shift)

STRATEGIC (Ongoing):
□ Implement automated anomaly alerts
□ Establish cost optimization reviews
□ Monitor pacing weekly for early intervention
